# Code For Good - Dallas 2018

## Instructions to run

### Installing all packages

Since this is both a Node.js and React.js implementation, there are multiple
folders that we have to install npm packages in. 

In the root folder of `code-for-good-dallas18`:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm i nodemon -g
$ yarn
$ cd client
$ npm install
```

### Checking functionality

If you're testing your backend:

```shell
$ node server.js
```

If you go to `localhost:5000/api/hello`, something should show up.

If you're testing frontend + backend:

```shell
$ yarn dev
```

If there's issues then :(
